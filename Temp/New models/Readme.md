# Testing area for new models

Onnx is not too consistent with its conversions not to mention its coherency across frameworks. I have developed the translator keeping in mind only a few models that I have created.

Hence, contributions are welcome in the form of (somewhat pre-trained) models, preferably convolutional. Supported model frameworks are:

- Tensorflow
- Keras
- Onnx
- Pytorch
- Caffe
- Chainer

It would be convenient if the code used to create the model is also uploaded (maybe in the form of the original source or just a screenshot of the model building code) due to the exact information it can provide.

Each and every contribution can have a pivotal role to play in the further development and enhanced compatibility of the model translator. Thank you for reading and looking forward to your contribution :)
